# onenote-to-obsidian-md-path-fix
This is designed to fix a few small problems in the files generated by OneNote-to-Obsidian[https://github.com/Segza/OneNote-to-Obsidian]

It is not yet finished, so you will need to tweak it for directories etc

Problems fixed
1) Remove the widths next to imported images(eg {width="7.28125in" height="5.302083333333333in"})
2) Fix URLs to media in a subfolder. The default stores the full file path in the note, which is not portable
    Sample before change: c:\temp\notes\BOOK1\SHEET1/media/pic1.jpg is changed to media/pic1.jpg
